  <b>
    I enjoy building and leading diverse and high performing teams to develop efficient practical solutions founded on theoretical understanding, and finding novel methods to solve challenging and inspiring problems.
  </b>
  <br />
  <br />
  <small>
    Apart from a few brief dalliances with other subjects, I've always loved maths and physics, and I relish solving inspiring and challenging problems, which is how I got into data science, analytics, and software engineering. I enjoy applying these approaches to real world challenges to help people make decisions at the right time, based on the right insight.
    <br />
    <br />
    I am a proponent of continuous improvement, and like to use agile working approaches to improve the way we work with clearly driven organisational structures that reflect the goals we are trying to achieve. I have helped to develop ways of working, internal team processes, organisation design and architecture, and operating models.
    <br />
    <br />
    I am frequently exploring new technologies and approaches, and interesting ways of combining existing approaches.
