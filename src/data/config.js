  detail: `
  <b>I enjoy leading a team to build efficient practical solutions founded on theoretical understanding, and developing novel methods to solve challenging and inspiring problems.</b>
  <br />
  <br />
  <small>
  Building on my strong technical background, I have developed a strong interest in statistical and probabilistic approaches, data analysis, visualization, and uncertainty quantification. I enjoy applying these to real world challenges to help people make decisions at the right time, based on the right insight.
  <br />
  <br />
  I am a proponent of agile working approaches and have worked with both Kanban and Scrum approaches, and helped to develop internal team processes and operating models.
  <br />
  I am frequently exploring new technologies and approaches, and interesting ways of combining existing approaches.
